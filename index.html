        <h1>Lillian<br>Hosken<br>McHenry</h1>
        <h2>NOVEMBER 3, 1924 - JUNE 20, 2022</h2>
        <p>A remarkable and dearly loved woman, mother, grandmother, and great-grandmother found a peaceful end following a fall that quelled her strong desire for independence. Lillian was known as quite a character among friends and family. She upheld a clear notion of what the correct manner was for every aspect of living and presented her firm opinions with a wonderful sense of humor. She regarded her family and friends as her most treasured gifts in life and was passionate about their well-being. Lil had little capacity for unfairness and suffering especially with children and animals.</p>
        <p>She was a mother figure to many. She adored her daughters Lyndie (Roger) Boulton and Laurie (Mark) Radcliff, grandchildren Katie (AJ) Ramsey, Thomas (Tiffany) Radcliff, Christina (Jason Lowe), Andrew (Edward) and Cameron (Ashley) Boulton, and great grandchildren Mia and Nic Ramsey, Lauren and Jace Radcliff, Audrey and Jackson Lowe, and Arlo Boulton. She delighted in knowing Arlo will have a baby sister in October.</p>
        <p>She grew up in Alameda and on her family ranch in Indian Valley, CA with a love of horses and various pets along the way. Lil and Jim married in 1945 and raised their family in Davis.  She was an active tennis player, swimmer, and bridge player in earlier years.  She and Jim enjoyed visiting Europe, Australia, New Zealand and parts of the U.S. with a tour group. Her husband Jim, parents William M. and Vera Medau Hosken, brother William E. Hosken, and nephew Edward (Ned) Hosken pre-deceased her. She is also survived by five Hosken nieces and many other family members.</p>
        <p>Her family is especially grateful for the devoted support offered by caregiving friend, Sahara Damore and Yolo Cares. Lil's ashes were buried next to her beloved Jim at Meadow Valley Cemetery near Bucks Lake where they both met as teens and later vacationed every summer at their cabin.</p>
